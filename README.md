# Alphanumerical BLAST

![Gameplay](gameplay.png)

Welcome to **A-BLAST**, a fun and engaging game where you shoot down enemies with alphanumeric bullets! This game is built using Python and the Pygame library.

## How to Play

Use the left and right arrow keys to move your gun. Press the space bar to shoot bullets. Each bullet is assigned a random character from alphanumericals.

When the game is paused, a "PAUSED" text will appear in the center of the screen. Press 'P' to pause and unpause the game.

## Features

- **Multishot**: After defeating a boss, you gain the ability to shoot multiple bullets at once for a short period of time.
- **Boss Enemies**: Occasionally, a boss enemy will appear. Boss enemies are larger and have more health than regular enemies.
- **Killer Enemies**: These enemies are dangerous! If they collide with your gun, the game ends.
